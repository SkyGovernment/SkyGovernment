## The Idea
The main idea here was that the Sky Government will evolve into an autonomous decentralized government. It will start with the Government's 'central' Bank.
Next will be many ministries under which will have few departments.

Starting from the 'central' Bank the government will be focusing on funding it activities within many Blockchains' Multiverse.

Hopefully we can get more funding so the process of development may accelerate faster.

For now we will develop incrementally whether we have funding or not. This project will be focused on the future especially after 2022.

The whole operation will start by one person manually learning and picking up along the way.

Every new innovation will be adopted as long as it can contribute to our advancement to one day becoming autonomous and fully decentralized even after the death of the founders.

Hopefully this objective is clear enough and we can together forge this 'Government' into reality.
